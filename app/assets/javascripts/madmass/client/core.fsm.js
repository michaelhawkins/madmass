   * Required params:
   * - name: state name
   *
   * Optional params:
   * - enter: callback called when entering the state
   * - leave: callback called when leaving the state
   *
   * The first added state is also the initial one. You can change initial
   * state using setInitial() method.
   *
   * Examples:
   *    var fsm = new Core.FSM;
   *    fsm.addState({name: 'state1', enter: enterCallback, leave: leaveCallback})
   *    fsm.addState({name: 'state2', enter: enterCallback})
   *    fsm.addState({name: 'state3'})
   *
   * Enter end leave callbacks will receive entering and leaving states as parameter.

  /* Adds a transition from one state to another.
   *
   * Required params:
   * - from: starting state for the transition. Event and condition will be checked in this state.
   * - to: destination state
   *
   * Optional params:
   * - event: event that triggers the transition.
   * - doing: callback for the transition
   * - allowed: callback that returns true or false OR boolean [true | false]. The transition is executed only if allowed is true.
   *
   * Why event is optional? Because if you do not specify an event, this transition will not wait for an
   * event but will trigger immediately, as soon as entering 'from' state. You can always specify a condition
   * to control the transition. Even if optional, in most cases you will specify the event.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   *    var fsm = new Core.FSM;
   *    fsm.addTransition({
   *      from: 'state1',
   *      to: 'state2',
   *      event: 'go',
   *      doing: transitionCallback,
   *      allowed: conditionCallback
   *    });
   *    fsm.addTransition({
   *      from: 'state2',
   *      to: 'state1'
   *    });
   *
   *    fsm.event('go');
   *
   *    In this example as soon as we enter state2 we will return to state1.
   *    Fired callbacks (we use states defined in addState):
   *      state1 leaveCallback,
   *      state1 => state2 transitionCallback,
   *      state2 enterCallback,
   *      state1 enterCallback
   *
   * Note: both 'from' and 'to' states must be defined before adding a transition among them.
   * Doing and allowed callbacks will receive a parameter representing the transition.
   * Example for the transition from state1 to state2:
   *    "state1 => state2"
