Contributing to MadMass
-----------------------
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.

**Note:** MADMASS is currently an experimental project. If you are willing to contribute please contact the developers first. They will
be happy to introduce you to the project and guide you in the learning process.
