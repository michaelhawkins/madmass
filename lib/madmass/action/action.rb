# This is the base class for any action and defines a specific action definition pattern. This pattern can be briefly described below:
#
# 1. Define a new action class (e.g. my_new_action) that inherits from this base class.
# 2. OPTIONAL: declare action_params set. You can declare the parameter set of my_new_action, using the #action_params filter method (see example below).
#    If a client uses my_new_action and tries to create an instance of this class sending a param not declared in #action_params,
#    a GameErrors::WrongInputError will be raised, hence, if my_new_action definition doesn't declare #action_params,
#    no params will be accepted in the action costruction (i.e. this action is a paramless action).
# 3. OPTIONAL: Override #process_params. All the #action_params  will be placed in the @parameters variable and  can be preprocessed
#    in the optional #process_params method (called before #applicable? and #execute methods).
# 4. MANDATORY: Override #applicable?. In #applicable? you have to verify the action preconditions. Any kind of checks can be performed here,
#    but in general this method has to verify that the current action respects the action rules in order to be executed.
#    #applicable? is a boolean method so it has to return true if the action can be executed
#    (i.e. if #execute method will be executed), false otherwise. When an action is not applicable, a GameErrors::NotApplicableError exception will be raised
#    by the system. In the #applicable? method, if a certain condition is not verified you can use #why_not_applicable to describe
#    the reason adding an error-entry in the form of key => message. This feature allows any client to know
#    why a certain action is not applicable through  #why_not_applicable method that returns an ActiveModel::Errors.
# 5. MANDATORY: Override the #execute method. All the action side effects on the current state of the world have to be performed here.
#    The execution of #applicable? and #execute will be executed by the system in a single transaction .
# 6. MANDATORY: Override #build_result method. Any executed action returns a percept. The percept content can be defined in the #build_result method accessing Madmass.current_perception.
#
# So the workflow is:
#
# <tt>declare accepted parameters => process parameters => check applicability => execution => return a percept</tt>
#
# Example:
#
#   class Action::MyAction < Madmass::Action::Action
#     action_params :name, :last_name
#
#     private
#
#     def process_params
#       @parameters[:name] = @parameters[:name].strip
#     end
#
#     def applicable?
#       case
#         when @parameters[:name].blank?
#           why_not_applicable.add(:name, "You must provide the name")
#         when @parameters[:last_name].blank?
#           why_not_applicable.add(:last_name, "You must provide the last name")
#       end
#
#       return why_not_applicable.empty?
#     end
#
#     def execute
#       puts "Your full name is : #{@parameters[:name]} #{@parameters[:last_name]}"
#     end
#
#     def build_result
#        Madmass.current_perception[:players] = Player.all
#     end
#
#   end
